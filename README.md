### Hi there üëã I'm Sanaz Zarei!

a FullStack Developer based in ***Amsterdam***. With a background in Computer Engineering and a degree from the University of Mazandaran, I bring a solid foundation in software development coupled with a passion for creating immersive digital experiences.

üöÄ Previously, I completed the rigorous Web Development Trainee program at HackYourFuture, which was an enriching experience where I delved into a multitude of new technologies and best practices in full-stack web development. During this time, I contributed to the design and development of a full-stack platform, gaining hands-on experience and valuable insights into collaborative teamwork and project execution.

üß† Currently learning TypeScript for enhanced projects.

ü§ù Eager to collaborate on exciting new projects.

üêæ Besides coding, I adore spending time with my cats.
